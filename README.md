## Something to say
This project is just for me. My old printer,  Canon ImageClass MF3222, could only work on Windows platform. But I'm a Mac user. So I decided to make this project. And now it has been running on a Windows Server 2008 R2 virtual machine  on my home CentOS server for a few days.  
(To someone boring: Don't consider reporting me as a pirate to Microsoft. I have a license for Windows Server 2008 R2.)

Please consider adding a HTTP basic authentication ahead of this script, if you don't want your printer to be a public one huh~

Feel free to make any changes to this project. Only one restriction is that your code must be open-source with GNU Affero Public License 3.0 to every user of your version.

Have fun!
